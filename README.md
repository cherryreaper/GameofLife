p5js Game of Life[https://editor.p5js.org/cherryreaper/sketches/iygr02Urg]

## Decription
This version of the game of life uses the class of cells to store the curretn and previous states of the cell. 
It starts by creating an empty 2D array and then filling it with Cells with a state of either 1 or 0.



To submit the assignment:
- Create a repo including your p5 sketch and a README markdown file
- In your README, place a link to the sketch running on editor.p5js.org and also include a brief paragraph or two 
describing the variation you implemented.
- Submit a link to the repo in the Canvas asssignment

If you need help implementing the original algorithm, check out [the Coding Train video on the Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg)
for extra insights.

IMPORTANT NOTE: there are *lots* of examples of the game of life in p5 floating around. Don't just copy one of these. Take the
time to read the chapter / watch the video / implement it yourself. It's very rewarding when it all finally works, I promise.
